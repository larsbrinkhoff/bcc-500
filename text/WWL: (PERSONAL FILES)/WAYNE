VERSE 1:
"YOU TOOK THE JOY RIGHT OUT OF MY LIFE, (YOUKNOWHO);
       I'D LIKE TO GET IN BED WITH YOUR WIFE, (YOUKNOWHO);
THE TIME WE'VE SPENT AT SCHOOL FOR YOU
       WORKING UP A SWEAT EACH NIGHT AND DAY...
WHILE YOU KEEP SEMI-U-ING IT
       AMC AND CPU-ING IT
CAN'T SEE HOW YOU KEEP DOING IT, (YOUKNOWHO).

VERSE 2:
"I GUESS WE WORK EACH HOLIDAY THRU, (YOUKNOWHO);
       WE WORKED WHEN JOHNSON PASSED AWAY TOO, (YOUKNOWHO);
WE MADE YOUR SYSTEM OPERATE;
       NOW WE HAVE A CHANCE TO TAKE A BREAK...
WE'LL TAKE OFF NEXT KUHIO DAY
       YOU'LL PROB'LY WORK THEN ANYWAY;
WHILE JACK & BONNIE SNEAK AWAY, (YOUKNOWHO).

VERSE 3:
"THERE'S ONE GUY YOU LOOK UP TO, I KNOW, (YOUKNOWHO);
       HIS NAME I GUESS IS !"#$%&'(), (YOUKNOWHO);
SINCE THOSE DAY BACK AT 1234567890
       YOU AND HE HAVE BEEN THE BEST OF PALS;
I'M GLAD HE'S ON THE OTHER TYYYTYTY;
       HIS HELP I'D NEVER EVER ASK,
HIS NOTES MAKE HIM LOOK LIKE AN 127757646, (YOUKNOWHO).

AMC, AMC, SEND A STROBE, LATCH THE PRI-OR-ITY;
       CAUSE THE SWAP IS COMING, THE DISK IS RUNNING,
       AND WHO KNOWS WHERE THE DRUM WILL BE?

HNE, ETC, HOPE WE DON'T GET A DAMNED RLV;
FOR EACH TRACK JUMP -- A TSU DUMP,
AND WE ALL LOSE TRACK OF THE LAST PMRD.

O LORD, WON'T YOU BUY ME AN AMTU.
