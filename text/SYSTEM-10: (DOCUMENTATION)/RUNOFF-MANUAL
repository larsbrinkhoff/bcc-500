         1.0_Introduction         ___ ____________

              RUNOFF is a document preparation  program  inspired  by
         the  program  of  the  same  name  written  by J. Saltzer at
         Project MAC.  This version has been improved to provide more
         extensive control over the format of the resulting document.
         Control over the output is exercised  by  the  user  in  two
         ways:


         (1)  By the use of special control characters inserted
              in text.  See Section 1.1.

         (2)  By the use of command lines inserted in the text.
              These lines begin with dot.  See Section 2.


         Text for input may be prepared using the  QED  text  editor.
         To  use  RUNOFF type "RUNOFF" to the Time-Sharing Executive.
         RUNOFF will respond with "LAYOUT FOR: " and the user  should
         type T for TELETYPE, P for PRINTER, or O for OTHER, followed
         by a "." or ",".  (This command is  used  to  determine  the
         physical  limits  of the printing device.)  Then the program
         types "INPUT FROM: ", at which point the  user  should  type
         the  input  file  name,  terminated  with either "." or ",".
         RUNOFF then transforms the input file into  an  intermediate
         form,  which  is  saved  on the file /$RUNOFF TEXT$/.  While
         RUNOFF is processing in pass I, any erroneous lines will  be
         designated  by  the  message "ERROR IN LINE n", where  n  is
         the QED line number of the  line  on  which  the  error  was
         detected.   In  certain  cases  the  actual  error  is  in a
         preceeding line.

              If the input file name was  terminated  with  ",",  the
         program  will type "MORE? " after processing the input file.
         The user should then type either Y  for  YES  or  N  for  NO
         followed  by ".".  If the answer is YES, RUNOFF will ask for
         the name of another input file.

              At the start of pass II, the program will type  "OUTPUT
         TO:  ",  and  the  user  should  give  a  scratch file name,
         terminated with either "." or ",".   If  the  file  name  is
         terminated  with ",", RUNOFF will type "INTERACTIVE HYPHENA-
         TION? ", and the user should respond with either Y for  YES,
         or  N  for  NO,  followed  by a ".".  (See Section 2.2 for a
         description of the interactive hyphenation process.)  Errors
         detected  in  pass  II  are  marked  with '*' in the output.
         RUNOFF will return to the Executive upon completion  of  the
         second  pass.   The  user  can then use the PRINT program to
         print the formatted file (see document R-36).

         1.1_Input_Text_Format_and_Format_Control_Characters         ___ _____ ____ ______ ___ ______ _______ __________

              Text input to RUNOFF consists of a symbolic  file  con-
         taining  both  the  document  to  be printed and the control
         information for formatting.  A physical line is a string  of
         characters  ending  with carriage return and line feed.  All
         physical lines which do not begin with  "."  are  considered
         lines  of  the  document to be output.  Initially, RUNOFF is
         set to "FILL" mode. All physical lines are collected into  a
         single,  logical,  line up to the occurence of a line break.
         The logical line is then broken into as many physical output
         lines  as  are needed to fit within the line margins.  These
         lines will then normally  be  adjusted  by  inserting  extra
         spaces  in  mid-line  so  that the end of the line is on the
         right margin. The end of a  logical  line,  or  line  break,
         occurs when one of the following conditions is met:


         (1)  There are one or more  blank  lines  between  two
              lines of text. (Extra blank lines in the text are
              ignored in fill-mode.   The  user  must  use  the
              appropriate command to produce spaces.)

         (2)  The next line begins  a  new  paragraph.  (RUNOFF
              recognizes  paragraphs  by  seeing  one  or  more
              blanks at the beginning of a line of text.)

         (3)  There is a logical line break.  This is  produced
              by  the  command  BREAK and certain other command
              lines.  (See the summary for a full listing.)


              Any character in an actual text line is interpreted  as
         text  except  for  the escape, shift, or tab character.  The
         escape character is initially "↑"  but  may  be  changed  by
         command  (see  Section  2.8); the initial shift character is
         "/", and tab is initialized to "\" (see Section  2.8).   The
         escape  character  and  the  immediately  following one have
         special meanings as defined below:


         ↑A   causes all subsequent upper  case  characters  in
              the  text to be printed as lower case characters.
              This changes ASCII characters 40-137  to  100-177
              octal.

         ↑L   converts upper case letters to lower case.  ASCII
              characters  41-72  become 101-132 octal.  This is
              the initial mode.
         RUNOFF Manual   May 20, 1976                          Page  3


         ↑U   Upper case-Do not convert to lower case  and  ig-
              nore "↑S" convention.

         ↑S   Shift-Do not convert the next upper case  charac-
              ter  as  above.   The shift character "/" has the
              same effect as "↑S".

         ↑D   converts the  subsequent  character  to  opposite
              case.   For  example,  "↑D←"  converts the "←" to
              "[right arrow]" in normal mode.

         ↑C   capitalizes the next word up to a space, carriage
              return, punctuation mark, or ↑E.

         ↑B   Backspace-Overprint the preceeding character with
              the next character.

         ↑I   underlines the next word up to a space,  carriage
              return, punctuation mark, or ↑E.

         ↑-   Underlines  all  characters  up  to  a   carriage
              return, or ↑E.

         ↑E   is used to force the end of underlining and capi-
              talization before the normal boundary occurs.

         ↑T   denotes the end of a field  for  formatting;  the
              tab character "\" may also be used.

         ↑Y   causes the current date to be output.

         ↑↑   Print an up arrow.
         ↑/   Print a slash
         ↑\   Print a backslash.  These control characters  are
              modified  in  the  obvious  manner if the escape,
              shift, or tab characters are changed.


              Any  uninterpretable  character  combination  will   be
         deleted and an error message will be printed.

         2.0_General_Information_about_Commands         ___ _______ ___________ _____ ________

              A command line begins with ".".  All letters  are  con-
         verted  to  upper case in recognizing the names of commands,
         macros, or formats.  Following  the  dot  RUNOFF  expects  a
         command  name or an abbreviation, followed by the parameters
         for that command, followed optionally by a  comment.   Lines
         beginning  with  dot but having an unrecognizable format are
         treated as errors.  No lines beginning with dot are  printed
         unless  the  preceeding line was .LITERAL.  All commands are
         described  below.   Abbreviations  for  command  names   are
         normally  based  on the first two letters of a one word com-
         mand or the first  letter  of  the  first  two  words  of  a
         multi-word  command.   Commands which should cause a logical
         line break do.  Information  on  abbreviations  and  whether
         commands  cause  line breaks will be found in the summary at
         the end of the  manual.   In  a  command  line  RUNOFF  will
         consider  multiple  blanks  as  a  single  blank, if a blank
         character is legal.



         2.1_General_Actions         ___ _______ _______


         .fill
         .nofill
         .format <name>
              These  commands determine which line-processing routine
              should  be  used.   ".fill"  causes  RUNOFF  to  either
              lengthen  short  lines  by  filling with words from the
              following  line  or  shorten  long  lines  by  breaking
              between  words.   Filling  will not take place across a
              line break.  In nofill-mode each  input  line  produces
              one output line; further blank lines are output in this                                                   ___
              mode.  ".format" causes subsequent text  to  be  output
              under  the control of the specified format (see below).
              Each following logical line will be fit into the format
              until a ".fill" or ".nofill" command is encountered.

         .adjust
         .nojust
              The  adjust  command  causes  all  lines  processed  in
              fill-mode, except the last one before a line break,  to
              be  right  justified.   This  is  the  initial state of
              RUNOFF.
         RUNOFF Manual   May 20, 1976                          Page  5


         .define format <name> <pos> <field definition>
         .end format
              These  commands  define  a  format for use in producing
              tables, etc.  The <name>  identifies  the  format;  the
              position  <pos>  may  be one of LEFT, RIGHT, or CENTER,
              and determines the overall position of the format  with
              respect  to  the  margins.  Each <field definition> has
              the form:

                     <type>(<letter> ... <letter>)
         
              where  the  <type> is one of L for left, R for right, C
              for center, F for fill, or J for  justify.   The  first
              three types define fixed fields; the text to be format-
              ted must fit within the  allotted  space.   The  latter
              types  define variable fields; the text will be handled
              as in normal fill mode processing.

         
              A  picture  showing  the manner in which text should be
              output follows the ".define format" command;  following
              the  picture  should  be  an  .end format command.  The
              following lines give an example:

                      .define format SUMMARY l(A) f(C) c(B)
                      AAAA  CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC  BBBBBBB
                            CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
                      .end format
         
              The  first  field of text is left-justified; the second
              is centered; the third is subjected to  fill-mode  pro-
              cessing without justification.  After the first line of
              output is generated using this format,  all  subsequent
              lines   are  produced  using  the  last  picture  line.
              (Strictly speaking the third line is unnecessary.)

         
              Text  for  formatted  processing  consists of a logical
              line (or paragraph).  Each field except the  last  must
              be  separated  by a tab ("\" or "↑T").  The first field
              of text is A; the second, B etc.  Typical input for our
              example might be:

                      1A\YES\/THIS IS SOME TEXT
                      TO BE FILLED.

         
              The  characters in the picture lines are interpreted as
              follows.  Contiguous sequences of letters determine the
              field  positions;  non-alphabetic characters are output
              literally.  (Note:  "q.qq" will not work; put  the  "."                                              ___
         RUNOFF Manual   May 20, 1976                          Page  6


              in the text.)  A sequence of characters written between
              double quotes is considered literal text.   The  double
              quotes  are  not  output,  and  there  is no way to use
              double quote as a literal.



         2.2_Hyphenation_Processing         ___ ___________ __________

              When interactive hyphenation is specified, RUNOFF  will
         type  "HYPHENATE:  <word>" when it finds a word which should
         be hyphenated and which is not in the  glossary.   The  user
         should  then  type  the  word with hyphens, and end the line
         with carriage return.  Control A and control Q may  be  used
         to correct typing errors.  If only carriage return is typed,
         RUNOFF will not try  to  hyphenate  the  word.   Interactive
         hyphenation  may be turned off by ending a word with control
         D instead of carriage return.

              At the end of processing, RUNOFF writes the glossary on
         the  file  '/$GLOSSARY$/'.   If RUNOFF aborts during proces-
         sing, "CONTINUE RUNOFF." may be used to dump the glossary.

              There are four conditions  which  must  be  met  before
         hyphenation takes place:


         (1)  RUNOFF must be in hyphenation mode.

         (2)  The text at the end of the line must consist of a
              non-alphanumeric    prefix,    followed   by   an
              alphabetic string (which may  also  include  "-",
              "/",   and   "'"   characters),   followed  by  a
              non-alphanumeric suffix.  The prefix  and  suffix
              may be empty.

         (3)  There must be at least two characters before  the
              hyphenation  point  and at least three characters
              after it.

         (4)  The number of spaces to be inserted per  word  on
              the  line  must  be greater than the .hyphenation
              break parameter (see below).


         If the word meets these conditions, then it will  be  broken
         at  a "-" or "/" (if any), or at the right-most hyphen which
         fits the line if it is in the glossary.
         RUNOFF Manual   May 20, 1976                          Page  7


         .hyphenate
         .nohyphen
              In  hyphenation  mode RUNOFF will try to find a word in
              the glossary which is the same (except for the  endings
              -S,  -ES,  -ED,  and -E) as the word at the  end of the
              line of text.  RUNOFF is initially in hyphen mode but a
              null  glossary  produces  nearly  the  same  effect  as
              NOHYPHEN mode.

         .glossary W
              This command inserts words into the glossary for use in
              hyphenation.   Each   word   should   have   the   form
              "hy-phen-ate"  and be separated by spaces.  (The double
              quotes should not be present.)                            ___

         .hyphenation break N
              This  command  sets  the parameter which determines the
              allowable number of spaces to be  inserted  in  a  line
              before  RUNOFF  tries to hyphenate the last word.  Each
              space counts ten points.  If more than  N   points  per
              word  would  have to be inserted, then hyphenation will
              be attempted.  The initial setting of this parameter is
              5 (one-half space per word).



         2.3_Margin_Controls         ___ ______ ________

              There are two types of margins involved in RUNOFF:


         (1)  The physical margins.  These  are  determined  by
              the  nature  of the printing device.  The margins
              outline the area where it is physically  possible
              to print characters, and are usually set with the
              LAYOUT option (see Section 1.0).

         (2)  The logical margins.  These can  be  set  by  the
              user  as  he  wishes.  (Limits are imposed by the
              physical  margins.)   They  are  initialized  for
              standard 8.5" by 11" printing.


         Commands concerning vertical and horizontal margins are:


         .page layout TM, BM, TOL
              This  sets  the  vertical  logical margins and vertical
              tolerance.  Parameters are top  margin,  bottom  margin
              and  tolerance.   The  tolerance  is  used to determine
              where to break between pages  on  page  overflows.   If
         RUNOFF Manual   May 20, 1976                          Page  8


              there  is  a line break within TOL lines of the bottom,
              RUNOFF will break the page  there;  otherwise  it  will
              fill the page completely.

         .line layout LM, RM, NC, CS
              This  sets  the  logical  left  and  right margins, the
              number of columns, and the number of spaces  to  insert
              between  columns.   These margins are used for the page
              headings.  To adjust the relative  text  position,  use
              the subsequent commands.

         .reduce margin LM, RM
         .expand margin LM, RM
         .end reduction
              These  commands  enable  the  user  to indent a certain
              portion  of  his  text  using  the  first  command,  or
              "undent"  his text using the second command.  In either
              case the original margins are  restored  by  the  third
              command.   The use of several ".reduce margin" commands
              before  the  corresponding  ".end  reduction"  commands
              succesively  indents  the  text  more,  and more.  Thus
              these commands are like brackets (ie recursive).  LM is                                                __
              added  to  the left logical margin and RM is subtracted
              from the right logical margin  in  the  first  command.
              Just  the  opposite  is  done  on  the  second command.
              Negative numbers are permitted.  These commands do  not
              affect the position of page headings.

         .layout PLM, PRM, PTM, PBM, LL, LO
              This  command  defines the physical margins in the fol-
              lowing complex manner.  (It should  only  be  used  for
              non-standard  devices; normally this command should not                                                                  ___
              be necessary.)  The parameters are  the  physical  left
              margin  (in  spaces),  the  physical  right margin, the
              physical top line, the physical bottom line,  the  line
              length,  and  line  origin.   The first four parameters
              define the physical limits of the printing device.  The
              final  two  parameters define the length of the logical
              line and its origin with respect to the  left  edge  of
              the paper.  Printing starts at column LO + LM, and ends
              at LO + RM, where LM and RM  are  the  logical  margins                                                     _______
              established by ".line layout".  When using the "facing"
              feature (see ".paging mode"), the logical  left  margin
              is  LL - RM on even pages, and the right margin is LL -
              LM. The parameters for the layout command must satisfy:

                 min(LO + LL - PLM, PRM - LO) >
                               max(PLM - LO, LO + LL - PRM),
                         LL > 25, and PBM - PTM > 6.
         
              This  command  sets LM to 15, RM to LL - 10, TM to PTM,
         RUNOFF Manual   May 20, 1976                          Page  9


              and BM to PBM - 6.  (These margin settings produce  the
              standard  1.5  inch  left,  and  1 inch right, top, and
              bottom margins.)


         Initially RUNOFF sets the margins for teletype output to:

                        .layout 6, 89, 6, 66, 85, 0
                        .line layout 15, 75
                        .page layout 6, 60, 4

         The printer layouts is:

                        .layout 5, 137, 6, 66, 85, 15
                        .line layout 15, 75
                        .page layout 6, 60, 4

         The logical margins must satisfy:

                 min(LL, PRM - LO, LO + LL - PLM) > RM >                                                  _
                       LM > max(0, PLM - LO, LO + LL - PRM),                          _
                   PBM > BM > TM > PTM, and BM - TM > TOL.                       _         _



         2.4_Paragraph_Formatting         ___ _________ __________


         .paragraph spacing N
              This specifies how many lines are to be inserted beteen
              paragraphs.  Initial setting = 1.

         .paragraph indentation N
              This  specifies how many additional spaces to insert at
              the beginning of a paragraph.  Initial setting = 5.

         .paragraph undentation N
              This  command  is  the  same as ".paragraph indentation
              -N".  That is, N  fewer  spaces  are  inserted  at  the
              beginning of the paragraph.



         2.5_Special_Line_Justification_and_Control         ___ _______ ____ _____________ ___ _______

              These commands pertain to the next logical  line.   The
         end of the line should be designated with a break.


         .center
              Center the next line.
         RUNOFF Manual   May 20, 1976                         Page  10


         .indent N
              Indent the next line N spaces.  If N is not provided, 5
              is assumed.

         .undent N
              Start  the next line N spaces to the left of the normal
              margin.  This command is the same as ".indent -N".

         .margin
              Justify the next line against the right hand margin.



         2.6_Heading_and_Paging         ___ _______ ___ ______


         .header XXXXXXX
              RUNOFF  accepts  a  heading  to go on the first line of
              each page.  The heading string is assumed to  start  at
              the  first  non-blank  character after the control word
              and end at carriage return.

         .heading mode <param>
              <param>  determines  the  postion of the heading on the
              line.  <param> may be any of the following.

              CENTER
                   The header will be centered on the line.

              MARGIN
                   The header will be adjusted against the right
                   margin.

              FACING
                   on even numbered pages the header is adjusted
                   against the right margin.  On odd pages it is
                   adjusted against the left margin.

              OPPOSED
                   the header will be adjusted against the oppo-
                   site margin from the page  number.   This  is
                   the initial mode.

         .paging mode <param>
              This command determines the placing of the page number.
              All parameters are optional.  <param> may be any one or
              more  of  the  following commands.  In case of conflict
              the latest command wins.
         RUNOFF Manual   May 20, 1976                         Page  11


              CENTER
                   The  page  numbers  are  centered between the
                   logical margins.

              MARGIN
                   The page number is adjusted against the right
                   margin.

              FACING
                   On  even  numbered  pages  the number will be
                   adjusted against the right  margin.   On  odd
                   numbered  pages  the  number will be adjusted
                   against the left margin.

              TOP
                   Page numbers are placed on the first line.

              BOTTOM
                   Page numbers are placed on the last line.

              OFF
                   Printing page numbers is discontinued.

              PREFIX "<string>"
              SECTION "<string>"
              SUFFIX "<string>"
                   The  strings  of characters between quotation
                   marks are used to form the page string, which
                   has the form:

                      <prefix><section><page number><suffix>.
              
                   Any or all of these strings may be null.  The
                   section string is considered to  be  part  of
                   the page number for purposes of indexing.


         
              Initial mode is:

                     .paging mode TOP MARGIN PREFIX "Page"
                     .paging mode SECTION "" SUFFIX ""

         
              If  neither  page  number nor heading is used, the text
              will start on the first  logical  line.   Otherwise  it
              will  start  on  the  fourth logical line.  If the page
              number is at the bottom, text will end  on  the  fourth
              line  from  the bottom.  If the paging and heading mode
              conflict, the page string overwrites the heading.
         RUNOFF Manual   May 20, 1976                         Page  12


         .odd page
              This control word causes the current page to be printed
              out and the next page  to  be  started  with  the  next
              higher odd number.

         .page N
              If  N is present, insert a page break and start number-
              ing the next page with N.  Otherwise, turn  the  paging
              mode on and do not insert a page break.

         .eject N
              Insert  a  page  break if either there are fewer than N
              lines left on the page or N is not present.



         2.7_Lines_and_Spacing         ___ _____ ___ _______


         .single space
              Single  space all lines within paragraphs.  This is the
              initial state.

         .double space
              Double space all lines within paragraphs.

         .space N
              Output  N  line  spaces.   If  N  is not provided, 1 is
              assumed.  In case of page overflow all remaining  blank
              lines to be output are deleted.

         .figure spacing N
              This  command  is  equivalent to ".eject N" followed by
              ".space N".  These commands provide the only  means  of
              creating blank lines.

         .break
              The lines before and after this command will not be run
              together in fill mode.  A simpler way  to  get  a  line
              break is to insert one or more blank lines in the text.

         .begin group
         .end group
              The  output  lines  enclosed between these two commands
              are forced to lie on a page.  Thus this command acts in
              a manner similar to ".eject N", where N has the 'right'
              value.

         2.8_Miscellaneous         ___ _____________


         .underline
              The following line is underlined.

         .literal
              The  next  line is taken as part of text whether or not
              it begins with dot.

         .escape <char>
         .shift <char>
         .tab character <char>
              The  given  character becomes the escape, shift, or tab
              character.  The parameter for the .shift and .tab char-
              acter  commands may be null, if no shift or tab charac-
              ter is desired.

         .define command <name>
         .end command
         .call <name>
              These commands give the user the opportunity to combine
              text and control lines to form his own  commands.   All
              text  and  command  lines  between the first and second
              commands is stored away  under  NAME.  When  the  third
              command  is executed, the stored string is read and the
              commands within the string are executed.  Recursion  is
              not permitted.

         .index <phrase>, <phrase>
              RUNOFF  saves  the first phrase in the main index table
              and the second phrase (if any)  in  a  sub-index  table
              associated with the first phrase.

         
              The  index  is formatted and output after the last page
              of text.  Two built-in but redefinable formats,  RINDEX
              and  SINDEX,  are  used to format the index as shown in
              the following example.

                        Algorithms, 40, 78,   ← uses RINDEX
                          analysis of, 27,    ← uses SINDEX
         
              The  following  lines  give the initial definitions for
              the indexing formats.

                      .define format RINDEX  f(A)
                      AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
                          AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
                      .end format

                      .end format

         
              In  order to get an index output in two columns, ".line
              layout 15, 75, 2, 4" should be the  last  line  of  the
              input.
         Summary of RUNOFF Commands   May 20, 1976            Page  15


         In the  summary  the  following  conventions  are  used  for
         parameters.
                        Symbol    Meaning
                           N    a number
                           C    a character
                           S    a string
                           W    a word (or name)
                           P    a general parameter
         Any symbol may be followed by *, indicating that its use  is
         optional  as  that parameter of the command.  If an optional
         parameter is left out, the effect is to not change the state
         of  RUNOFF, except where stated otherwise above.  The use of
         + following a break type indicates that the actual break  is
         dependent on the value or presence of the parameter.
