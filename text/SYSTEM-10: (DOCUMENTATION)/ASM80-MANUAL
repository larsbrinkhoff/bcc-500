         8080 CROSS-ASSEMBLER                                  Page  1         ____ _______________


              The cross-assembler implemented on the BCC is a  subset
         of the INTEL 8080 cross-assembler and is directly compatible
         with the IMSAI self contained  operating  system  assembler.
         Major differences between INTEL  and BCC are as follows:


                     1)  Macro capability is not provided.

                     2)  The following pseudo ops are not  suppor-
                         ted:
                              a) SET
                              b) IF
                              c) ENDIF
                              d) MACRO
                              e) ENDM
                              f) TITLE


                     3)  Only simple expressions involving the op-
                         erators  '+'  and  '-'  are allowed.   No
                         parenthesis are permitted.

                     4)  A comment statement may be  signalled  by
                         placing  a  '*'  as a first character in-
                         stead of a ';'.

                     5)  "DB" and  "DW"  instructions  can  define
                         only  single  byte or single word quanti-
                         ties respectively.

              An added feature of the BCC implementation is the  gen-
         eration  of a cross-reference table which follows the assem-
         bly listing and pseudo comments to control  the  listing  of
         the source program.

                     1)  The symbol table can accomodate 1000 sym-
                         bols.

                     2)  Cross-reference capacity depends  on  how
                         many  symbols  there  are  in  the symbol
                         table.  For example  if  there  are  1000
                         defined symbols the cross-reference table
                         can accomodate a a maximum of 3000 refer-
                         ences.   Similarly, if there are 250 sym-
                         bols, (4000 - 250 = 3750) references  are
                         allowed.

         Use_Of_The_Cross-Assembler         ___ __ ___ _______________

              Enter the  cross-assembler  from  the  exec  by  typing
         "ASSM" followed by a carriage return.  The program will then
         ask you for a source, object, file and list.

              Usual file naming conveniences apply  here.   Terminate
         all  names  with  a carriage return.  Control characters may
         be used to correct your entry in the usual manner.  If a bad
         file  name  is  entered,  the  request  for a name is simply
         repeated.  The listing file and table file may be suppressed
         by entering only a carriage return.

              The format of the object file is described by the IMSAI
         manual which follows.


         Pseudo_Comments         ______ ________

              Pseudo comments are comments which  are  recognized  by
         the  assembler.   These special commands enclosed in comment
         statements control the listing of the program  being  assem-
         bled.  For example, the statement:

         * %NOPRINT

         Will suppress the listing of any  statements  following  the
         "NOPRINT"  pseudo  comment.  Other commands to control list-
         ings are as follows:


                         PRINT   - Restores listing of statements.
                         PAGE    - Causes a page effect.
                         TITLE   - The first 28 characters following
                                 - this  text  will  be  used as the
                                 - title.


         Hence the format of pseudo comments is:


                   *  %<COMMAND> <Optional Operand>
                   â†‘
                   start at col 1.



              The reason for  implementing  these  commands  in  this
         somewhat  awkward manner is to retain compatibility with the
         IMSAI  and  INTEL  assemblers.   Note  that  a  ';'  may  be
         substituted for an '*'.

         OBTAINING_OUTPUT         _________ ______

              The list file may be printed out by either the  TTY  or
         line  printer.   When listing on the TTY, one should use the
         "TYPE" command.  To use the line printer, the  "PRINT"  rou-
         tine   is  used along with the "ABSOLUTE option".  Hence, to
         submit the list file "TLIST" for printing on the line print-
         er, one enters at the exec level


                        @PRINT TLIST,A

              To obtain  the  object  code  one  must  translate  the
         M1-ASCII  to regular  ASCII before punching the tape.  To do
         this, use the subsystem "TRANS" which asks for the input M-1
         file  and  output ASCII file.  To punch the translated tape,
         use the "PUNCH" command.  Note that this  command  is  valid
         only on a KDF terminal.  After entering the punch subsystem,
         turn on the punch, then enter:

                        PU <Full file name> Cr


              Note that the fully qualified file  name  must  be  en-
         tered.  E.g., @GUEST:OBJECT:SYM.

              Return to the exec by typing "FIN".
