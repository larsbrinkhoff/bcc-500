REQUIRED TO GET THE FILE INTO CORRECT FORMAT FOR THE LABEL-MAKING
PROGRAM.
}'/THE FORMAT OF THE ADDRESSEE FILE IS QUITE SIMPLE.
/THE FILE CONSISTS OF AN ENTRY (A FEW LINES OF TEXT) FOR EACH MAILING LABEL TO BE PRINTED.
/ENTRIES ARE SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER BY A SINGLE LINE WHICH BEGINS WITH ONE OR
MORE ASTERISKS.
/AFTER THE INITIAL ASTERISK THE SEPARATOR LINE MAY CONTAIN ANY
INFORMATION WHICH MIGHT BE LATER USEFUL FOR FILE MAINTENANCE.
/THE SIZE OF A MAILING LABEL RESTRICTS THE NUMBER OF LINES
IN EACH ENTRY TO BE NO MORE THAN FIVE.
/SIMILARLY, EACH LINE MAY HAVE IN IT NO MORE THAN 39 CHARACTERS.
/IF EITHER OF THESE RESTRICTIONS IS VIOLATED, THE LABEL-MAKING
PROGRAM WILL TRUNCATE THE INFORMATION TO FIT WITHIN THE
AVAILABLE SPACE ON THE LABEL.
