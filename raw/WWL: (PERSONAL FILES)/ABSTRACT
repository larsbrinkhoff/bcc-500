}'/THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE MULTIPROCESSOR ^CBCC 500 COMPUTING
SYSTEM IS DESCRIBED.
/THIS SYSTEM -- THE PROTOTYPE FOR A LARGE RESOURCE-SHARING COMPUTING
SYSTEM -- WAS DESIGNED AND CONSTRUCTED IN 1969-70, BUT HAS NOT BEEN
REPORTED EXTENSIVELY IN THE LITERATURE.
/IT CONSISTS OF A NUMBER OF MICROPROCESSORS, EACH WITH A 
100 NSEC CONTROL STORE AND WITH ACCESS TO A MULTI-PORT, MULTI-MODULE
CENTRAL MEMORY.
/TWO OF THESE PROCESSORS ARE USED TO IMPLEMENT FAIRLY CONVENTIONAL
^CCPU^ES.
/THE REST ARE DEDICATED TO BASIC OPERATING SYSTEM TASKS (SCHEDULING,
SWAPPING, TERMINAL MANAGEMENT) WHICH ARE PERFORMED DIRECTLY IN 
MICROCODE.
/EXPERIENCE WITH THE SYSTEM IS DISCUSSED, AND AN EVALUATION OF THE
BASIC ARCHITECTURE AND THE USE OF THE MICROPROCESSORS IN IT IS GIVEN.
/IT IS CLAIMED THAT THE USE OF POWERFUL MICROPROCESSORS AND THE
ARCHITECTURE THEY MAKE POSSIBLE CONTRIBUTE DIRECTLY TO A WELL-MODULARIZED
OPERATING SYSTEM THAT IS SIMPLE TO BUILD AND CHECK OUT AND EASY TO
UNDERSTAND AND MAINTAIN.
