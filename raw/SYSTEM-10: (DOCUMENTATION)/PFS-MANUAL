         1.0  INTRODUCTION


              This is a users' guide for  a  subsystem  designed  for
         long-term  storage  of  files.   The  system  was originally
         intended for temporary use during the early  development  of
         the  BCC 500.  Because of the turn of events, however, it is
         still with us and probably will be throughout  the  life  of
         the  500.   In some ways the use of PFS has distinctly posi-
         tive benefits; the user has good  control  over  his  files,
         their  various  back-up  copies, and/or previous versions of
         them.  Its principal disadvantages are that it requires  the
         user  to  remember to write out his files before logging out
         of the system and its slightly different file-naming conven-
         tions  from  that of the basic 500 system.  These are really
         minor, however, and the user should be able quickly to adapt
         to the use of PFS.

              Any large computing system making use of on-line access
         requires a means for storing and retrieving large quantities
         of information which must be accessed  during  computations.
         A common example of this is the storage of programs and data
         files which they require or generate.  These files  must  be
         readily  accessible,  since it frequently costs much time to
         read them into the system over and  over  again  from  paper
         tape  or card media.  This is especially true for the remote
         user.

              Large operating systems facilitate  on-line  access  by
         providing  mechanisms  for naming and handling files and for
         storing  them,  usually  on   disk.    Unfortunately,   even
         well-developed operating systems are subject to failure, and
         it is likely that valuable information can be lost  at  such
         times.   The  reasons  for  such  loss  mostly stem from the
         design of the operating system's directory  structures.   If
         they  are damaged by the failure, then the system may become
         totally confused about its files.  Approaches all  requiring
         some  type  of redundancy in the directory structures can be
         used to remedy this serious problem, but most  of  them  can
         lead  to  system inefficiencies, and, in any event, to added
         system complexity.

              The basic idea  of  PFS  is  to  remove  the  permanent
         storage of files from the duties of the operating system and
         assign the file storage to a user-level sub-system.  PFS  is
         designed  in a very simple, straightforward manner, removing
         much of the flexibility of a fancier system, but providing a
         much higher degree of integrity for user files.
         PFS Reference Manual    May 1, 1974                   Page  2


         2.0  PFS DESIGN AND USE


              To accommodate PFS a portion of the disk file has  been
         removed  from the domain of the 500's operating system.  PFS
         accesses this portion of the disk file as  a  classical  I/O
         device.   That  is,  only PFS makes decisions concerning the
         allocation of the storage and the absolute addresses of  the
         records  being  written or read from disk.  Each system user
         is allocated a fixed area of this storage.  The user's space
         is divided into a number of pages, the first one of which is
         used for a file directory.  The PFS  directory  page  has  a
         number  of  entries  which  are in one to one correspondence
         with the other pages in the user space.  As files are copied
         into  the  PFS  user  space,  the  (non-directory) pages are
         filled on an as available basis.

              When the user logs in to the  500  system,  he  usually
         finds  that  his  files are not known by the system.  Before
         proceeding, then, the user enters PFS and  instructs  it  to
         copy  the  requisite  files  from the permanent storage area
         into the operating system's  file  storage  area.   He  then
         works  with  his  files,  and  before leaving the system, he
         reenters PFS and instructs it to copy his updated files from
         the  operating system back onto the permanent area.  Because
         this operation is entirely manual and  requires  the  user's
         attention and consideration, and because the copying operat-
         ion is relatively fast, the user's files are thus reasonably
         secure from system malfunctions.



                                   WARNING

                   The user must remember that  it  is  his
                   responsibility to copy back to PFS those
                   files which he has  changed  during  his
                   computation  session  and  that  all his
                   work will be lost if he  forgets.   Good
                   practice    requires   that   the   user
                   occasionally write out files which  have
                   changed even during a session -- in case
                   the system should  go  down  after  some
                   reasonable amount of work.
         PFS Reference Manual    May 1, 1974                   Page  3



              Satisfactory evidence of the merit of this approach  is
         that  in  over seven years of operation of PFS-like systems,
         only a very small number of files have been lost by  operat-
         ing system or hardware malfunction.  This should be contras-
         ted with other systems in which the approach is  to  provide
         protection  within  the  system  itself;  in  such cases the
         losses have been much greater.  Of course, the user  himself
         can foul up, and the hardware can fail; but these situations
         are tolerably low in frequency.

              As a matter of good  practice,  of  course,  users  are
         reminded  that  it  may be wise to write out a file onto the
         permanent storage area at regular intervals as their console
         sessions  progress (assuming the files are changing) so that
         in case of a system crash a relatively small amount of their
         work will be lost.

              Users can have access to the directories of other users
         in  reasonablly  controlled  ways and can share files.  They
         can change the accessibility of their  files  to  themselves
         and  to  other  users  and  can do a number of other actions
         related to maintenance of their own directories.

              The following is a simple summary of PFS commands.  The
         reader can easily learn to use PFS by reading it.
         PFS Reference Manual    May 1, 1974                   Page  4


         3.0  PFS COMMANDS


              Upon entering PFS, the user sees the PFS  herald,  "&".
         The  user can then type one or more commands.  The commands,
         except  for  arguments  like  file  names,   are   generally
         one-letter  commands,  i.e., the user types the first letter
         of the command and the rest of it is supplied by PFS.   Most
         of  the  commands must be confirmed by typing a ".".  In the
         following, the characters which must be typed  by  the  user
         are  underlined; the characters "<" and ">" are meta-symbols
         to designate the type of object which PFS expects.

              Three types of file names are  mentioned  below:  <file
         name>,  <disk  file  name>, and <system file name>.  <system
         file name>s use the  500  System  file  naming  conventions.
         <disk  file  name>s  have  a  slightly different convention:
         names may not be longer than thirteen  characters  and  must
         consist  of  letters,  digits, "-", and ":".  The term <file
         name> is used in those situations where the name is  both  a
         <disk file name> and a <system file name> and must therefore
         conform to an intersection of both naming conventions.

              It is possible under certain rules to  refer  to  files
         belonging to other users, i.e., files in other users' direc-
         tories.  These files may be designated by their  usual  file
         name, preceded by the directory-owner name; e.g.,

                        @<user name>:<disk file name>

         Thus, this document may  be  retrieved  on-line  from  WWL's
         directory by referring to it as

                              @WWL:PFS-DOCUMENT

              PFS requires that user names -- when they are  supplied
         --  be  typed  perfectly.   If  a  user makes a typing error
         during a user name, he  can  abort  the  command  by  typing
         control-K.   The  file  name  can  have preceding characters
         removed by the use  of  control-A.   As  each  control-A  is
         typed,  PFS  echoes "^" to signify backing up one character.
         If the user feels it is more convenient, he can  also  abort
         the  command  with  a  control-K.  Typing two control-K's in
         succession will cause the user to leave PFS  and  return  to
         the executive language processor.
         PFS Reference Manual    May 1, 1974                   Page  5


         3.1  Leaving PFS

              The user may get out of PFS and return to the executive
         language  processor by typing two control-K's in succession.
         Alternatively he may use the PFS command:


             &FINISHED.              `       `



         3.2  Transfer Commands

              Only two commands actually  do  the  transfers  between
         disk  and  the  system  required  for  long-term storage and
         retrieval:  READ and WRITE.  Occasionally error  diagnostics
         may accompany a transfer command.  PFS is quite conservative
         about disk errors at the present time and reports any errors                                                           ```
         which  occur  without  automatically  retrying.   Diagnostic
         messages are discussed in  Section  4.   All  such  messages
         should  be reported to hardware maintenance, and the command
         should be immediately repeated.



             3.2.1  Copying  a  file  from  the  system  to  PFS
                  storage


             &WRITE DISK FILE <file name>;  (<reminder>)              `               ````````````  ````````````

          or &WRITE DISK FILE <disk file name>.  (<reminder>)              `               `````````````````  ````````````
             FROM <system file name>.                  ```````````````````

                  Copies a file from the system onto the perman-
                  ent  storage area.  The date & hour are recor-
                  ded, and the file's type  is  preserved.   The                                      ````
                  reminder  is  one  of  two  messages, (NEW) or
                  (OLD), and serves to remind the user  that  he
                  is  creating a new file or writing over an old
                  one.  Either situation can occur as the result
                  of  an  error  on  the part of the user.  Note
                  that if the user utilizes the  short  form  of
                  the  command  (i.e., terminates it with a ";")
                  the reminder message occurs  after  the  fact;
                  the  file will be written anyway.  If the user
                  utilizes the long form of the  command  (i.e.,
                  uses  two  "."   terminators),  the second "."
                  serves to confirm the data transfer after  the
                  reminder  shows  the  user what he is about to
                  do.  Beginning users should use the long  form
         PFS Reference Manual    May 1, 1974                   Page  6


                  of the command until they have more confidence
                  with PFS.



             3.2.2  Copying a file from permanent  storage  into
                  the system


             &READ DISK FILE <file name>;              `              ````````````

          or &READ DISK FILE <disk file name>.              `              `````````````````
             TO <system file name>.                ```````````````````

                  Inverse of the write disk file command.




         3.3  File Directory Commands

              The user must be able to inspect the  contents  of  his
         directory  from  time to time.  Occasionally he may forget a
         file name, or he may want to see when he created it or  last
         updated  it.   Files  also have associated a number of other
         parameters which he may want to inspect or to verify that  a
         change  he has just made is correct.  Too, users may want to
         look at other users' directories.   The  following  commands
         facilitate  the  inspection  and modification of directories
         and items contained within them.



             3.3.1  Listing the contents of a file directory


             &LIST.              `   `

          or &LIST FOR USER @<user name>:.              `   `         ``````````````

                  The PFS directory for the  indicated  user  is
                  listed.    All   information   concerning  the
                  various files for  the  user  is  printed  for
                  those items not invisible under access protec-
                  tion.
         PFS Reference Manual    May 1, 1974                   Page  7


             3.3.2  Listing only the file names within a  direc-
                  tory


             &BRIEF LIST.              `         `

          or &BRIEF LIST FOR USER @<user name>:.              `         `         ``````````````

                  Same as above except only the file  names  are
                  printed.  This command is frequently used when
                  a user has forgotten the exact name of a  file
                  or  is looking for the presence of a file in a
                  directory.   It  is  faster  than   the   LIST
                  command.



             3.3.3  Looking at the parameters for a given file


             &EXAMINE FILE <file name>.              `            ````````````

          or &EXAMINE FILE @<user name>:<file name>.              `            `````````````````````````

                  Prints all the  information  that  LIST  would
                  print except only for the indicated file.



             3.3.4  Changing a file name


             &CHANGE FILE NAME <old name>.              `                ```````````
             TO <new name>.                ```````````

          or &CHANGE FILE NAME @<user name>:<old name>.              `                ````````````````````````
             TO <new name>.                ```````````

                  The use of  the  command  is  obvious.   Users
                  cannot  normally  change the names of files in
                  other users' directories as the second form of
                  the   command   implies  above.   Section  3.3
                  discusses file sharing and protection.
         PFS Reference Manual    May 1, 1974                   Page  8


             3.3.5  Deleting a file from the directory


             &DELETE FILE <file name>.              `           ````````````

          or &DELETE FILE @<user name>:<file name>.              `           `````````````````````````

                  The use of the command is obvious.  The  space
                  occupied  by  the file being deleted is avail-
                  able for re-use.



             3.3.6   Checking  the  amount  of  available   disk
                  storage space


             &UNUSED SPACE.              `           `

          or &UNUSED SPACE FOR USER @<user name>:.              `                     ``````````````

                  Prints the number of unused disk pages in  the
                  indicated user's allocation.
         PFS Reference Manual    May 1, 1974                   Page  9


         3.4  File Accessibility Commands:  File Sharing and  Protec-
              tion

              Files written on the disk  are  provided  with  one  of
         several  levels of access to each of three classes of users:
         its owner(s), the public, and to that subset of  the  public
         who  may  know  a special password associated with the file.
         These  accesses  are  called  respectively,  owner   access,                                                      `````   ``````
         general access, and password access.         ``````` ``````      ```````` ``````

              Each access class may have one of four levels:   invis-                                                               `````
         ible  (-),  inaccessible  (N), read-only (R), and read-write         ````        ````````````       `````````          ``````````
         (W).  When a file is first written it is given  the  initial
         accesses:

                             owner:    W                             `````
                             password: - (- means here "no access")                             ````````
                             general:  N                             ```````

         Thus the newly-created file is read-write  to  its  owner(s)
         and inaccessible to all others.

              The reader will recall that the users of PFS  may  list
         the  directories of other users and attempt to read or write
         their files.  The algorithm used by PFS to check an  attemp-
         ted  access  for validity is straightforward:  first a check
         is made to see whether the user attempting the access is  an
         owner;  if  so,  then is the nature of the access legal?  If
         the ownership test fails, then does the password (if one  is
         typed)  match;  and  if  so, is the nature of the access now
         legal?  Finally, is the attempted access legal  for  general
         users?   If  the  answer  to  all these questions is no, the
         access is denied.  When a  user  lists  the  contents  of  a
         directory  which he does not own, all files marked invisible
         will be skipped.

              Ownership of a directory is  required  to  be  able  to
         execute  several  PFS  commands.  Users cannot, for example,
         CHANGE  or  DELETE  file  names  without  ownership  status.
         Ownership is also required to do those commands which change
         the accesses from their initial values.  These commands  are
         given below.

              Files with passwords associated with them are  referred
         to  much  as  a  general  user  reference  is made, i.e., by
         specifying a user name with the file name, except the  pass-
         word  is  supplied  in parentheses after the user name.  PFS
         does  not  echo  the  password.   For  example,  a  password
         reference would be typed as:

                          @WWL(<password>):SOME-FILE
         PFS Reference Manual    May 1, 1974                  Page  10


         Because of the non-echoing  password  the  file  name  would
         appear on the terminal as

                               @WWL():SOME-FILE



             3.4.1  Changing general access to files


             &GENERAL ACCESS TO FILE <file name>.              `                      ````````````
             IS -/N/R/W.                ` ` ` ``

          or &GENERAL ACCESS TO FILE @<user name>:<file name>.              `                      `````````````````````````
             IS -/N/R/W.                ` ` ` ``

                  The construct -/N/R/W means - or N or R or  W.                                ` ` ` `         ``   ``   ``
                  -  means  the file is invisible; general users
                  cannot see the file in a directory listing.  N
                  stands for inaccessible; general users can see
                  it in the directory but can't get at it.  R is
                  for read-only, and W means read-write.



             3.4.2  Changing password access to files


             &PASSWORD ACCESS TO FILE <file name>.              `                       ````````````
             IS (<password>)-/N/R/W.                 ```````````` ` ` ``

          or &PASSWORD ACCESS TO FILE @<user name>:<file name>.              `                       `````````````````````````
             IS (<password>)-/N/R/W.                 ```````````` ` ` ``

                  Same as above, but for  password  access.   In
                  this case the "-" stands for "no such access."
                  It is used to remove existing password  access
                  for a file.  In this case the password portion
                  is echoed to the user as confirmation  of  the
                  new password.
         PFS Reference Manual    May 1, 1974                  Page  11


             3.4.3  Changing owner access to files


             &OWNER ACCESS TO FILE <file name>.              `                    ````````````
             IS -/N/R/W.                ` ` ` ``

          or &OWNER ACCESS TO FILE @<user name>:<file name>.              `                    `````````````````````````
             IS -/N/R/W.                ` ` ` ``

                  Same as above, but for owner  access.   If  an
                  owner  wants to prevent himself from overwrit-
                  ing an important file, he  can,  for  example,
                  set his owner access to read-only.  Of course,
                  he can set it back whenever he wishes.




         3.5  Pseudo-ownership and Abbreviations:  More File Sharing

              Most files are owned by the user  creating  them;  they
         contain information of interest only to him and remain under
         his private jurisdiction.  Some files, however, are of wider
         interest.   While the owner may wish to retain the privilege
         of modifying them, others may have the right to  read  them.
         Files  in  this  category  are  easily  handled  by means of
         general and password accesses.  Some files may  need  to  be
         written  occasionally  by others.  Again the password access
         mechanism will suffice for this  situation.   Finally,  how-
         ever,  there  is  a  small  number  of  files  which require
         frequent read-write  access  by  several  individuals.   The
         password mechanism becomes cumbersome if it must be used too
         frequently.

              PFS provides a means by which several users  may  enjoy
         almost  all  the privileges of ownership of files in a given
         directory.  This  status  is  called  pseudo-ownership,  and                                               ````````````````
         users  having  it are called friends of the directory owner.                                      ```````
         Friends can execute all of the operations and  commands  the
         directory  owner can do except modify the list of friends of                                 ``````
         the owner.  There may be as many as twelve  friends  of  any
         directory owner.

              The list of friends may  be  set  or  modified  by  the
         following command:
         PFS Reference Manual    May 1, 1974                  Page  12


             3.5.1  Equating an item number to a user name


             &MODIFY ITEM #<item number>.              `            ````` ````````
             TO USER @<user name>:.                     ``````````````

                  This command permits the owner to  change  the
                  friend  list  for  his directory.  His friends
                  are designated by the numbers  1  through  12.
                  The  friend  list  is  given  in the directory
                  listing by the LIST command.  A user name  may
                  be  removed  from  the  list  by typing "-" in
                  place of the expected user name.



              The MODIFY ITEM command permits two additional items to
         be  set to user names.  Item 13 determines the identity of a
         user who may be referred to  merely  by  "<",  and  item  14
         determines  who  is  ">".   These two symbols may be used in
         place of a user name at any point in PFS.  Thus if  a  given
         user is himself the friend of another user and finds himself
         doing file operations frequently in that other user's direc-
         tory,  the  symbols  "<"  and ">" can greatly facilitate his
         references.

              For example, it is much easier to type

                                <SHARED-FILE.

         than it is to type

                         @LICHTENBERGER:SHARED-FILE.

         Items 13 and 14 may be returned to  null  by  means  of  the
         MODIFY ITEM command, specifying "-" in place of the expected
         user name.



              It may be that a user has a number of  files  which  he
         wants  accessed  by  friends  but  others  he  wants to keep
         private.  PFS does not provide a finer access  control  than
         those mechanisms previously mentioned.  It is possible, how-
         ever, to remedy the  situation  just  mentioned,  especially
         when a number of users are working on a similar project.
         PFS Reference Manual    May 1, 1974                  Page  13


              A fictitious user directory can be established.   (This
         cannot be done just to accommodate a few files.)  No user of
         the system is then the true owner of the  directory,  and  a
         number  of  users can establish themselves as friends of the
         directory and interact accordingly.  All that remains is  to
         provide  a  means  for  these  mutual  owners  to change the
         constitution of the friend  list.   To  do  this  they  must
         become,  for  the  moment,  the real owner.  This is done by
         tricking PFS -- with the following command -- into  assuming
         a new identity for the user.

              The command, which detaches the user from his  own  PFS
         directory and attaches him to the new directory, is:



             3.5.2  Attaching the user to a new directory


             @<user name>:(<password>).             ``````````````````````````

                  When a user enters PFS, he is given the direc-
                  tory  associated  with  his name.  If for some
                  reason he wishes to  assume  a  new  identity,
                  i.e., take over the directory of someone else,
                  then he uses this command.  But he  must  know
                  the  password  of the new user.  This password
                  is identical to the new user's TSS password.

         3.6  Miscellaneous Commands



              PFS  contains  a   few   other   commands   which   are
         occasionally useful.  These are listed below.



             3.6.1  Verifying the integrity of the user's data


             &VERIFY DATA.              `          `

          or &VERIFY DATA FOR USER @<user name>.              `          `         `````````````

                  The entire set of disk pages is read one at  a
                  time  for  error checking purposes.  If a disk
                  error is encountered, a diagnostic message  is
                  typed giving the physical disk address and the
                  nature of the  error.   Such  episodes  should
                  always  be reported to the hardware people for
                  investigation.   Normally,  the  use  of  this
                  command  should  not  be required, as all disk
                  pages are reread upon writing, and their  con-
                  tents  are  compared with that of the original
                  system file.



             3.6.2  Typing out correspondence of file pages with
                  physical disk pages


             &STATUS.              `     `

          or &STATUS FOR USER @<user name>:.              `     `         ``````````````

                  Prints the contents of the PFS directory show-
                  ing  the  utilization  of the various physical
                  disk pages allocated to the indicated user.



             3.6.3  Permanently discard physical disk page  from
                  user directory


             &ABANDON FILE <file name>.              `            ````````````

          or &ABANDON FILE @<user name>:<file name>.              `            `````````````````````````
         PFS Reference Manual    May 1, 1974                  Page  15


                  Ownership access is required.   Command  works
                  precisely  like delete file except that as the
                  file is deleted, each page is  read  once  for
                  possible  errors.  If an error is encountered,
                  the page involved is  marked  as  bad  and  is
                  permanently  removed from the user's available
                  space so as not to  cause  further  difficulty
                  for the user.  The hardware maintenance people
                  should be informed of any disk pages which are
                  deleted  as  a  consequence of the use of this
                  command.  The command should be regarded as an
                  extreme measure.



             3.6.4  Conversing with another user in PFS


             &"<arbitrary text>              `````````````````


                  If another user links to a given user while he
                  is  in  PFS,  the " command causes PFS to stop
                  interpreting commands or file names and permit
                  the  user to carry out a conversation of arbi-
                  trary length (any number of  carriage  returns
                  can  be  included  in  the  text).   The  user
                  escapes from this mode with control-K.

         4.0  PFS ERROR MESSAGES


              PFS does a considerable amount of checking for  various
         kinds  of errors.  The integrity of the users' files depends
         on the various checks that are done.   The  disk  file  unit
         reports  several  types  of  data  transfer  errors, but PFS
         checks data further.   Each  directory  as  it  is  read  is
         checked for correctness of content; this is also done before
         writing the directory after updating.  Each data block writ-
         ten  on the disk is re-read during the writing operation and
         compared with the correct information.

              All these checks and others give rise to the  following
         error messages and their interpretations.



             NOT ENOUGH ROOM

                  This message signifies that  the  file  to  be
                  written  will not fit into the available space
                  on the disk.  The standard remedy is  to  list
                  the  directory contents.  This usually reveals
                  some junk files which can be deleted  to  make
                  room.


             ?

                  This message means that the user is attempting
                  an  operation which is improper.  The user may
                  be denied the attempted access or he may  have
                  typed  an  incorrect  file name, user name, or
                  password.   Basically  the  message  means  to
                  think more carefully and try again.


             REREAD ERROR

                  This message is typed during a WRITE operation
                  if  the data is somehow written incorrectly on
                  the disk.  The checking operation  is  similar
                  to  the read-after-write checks done by magne-
                  tic tape units.  The user  should  repeat  the
                  WRITE  command.   The  message includes track,
                  band,  sector,  and  unit  information   which
                  should  be  reported  to  hardware maintenance
                  personnel.
         PFS Reference Manual    May 1, 1974                  Page  17


             TSU DUMP...

                  This message is given by any read error detec-
                  ted   by  the  disk  hardware.   Track,  band,
                  sector, and unit information  is  included  in
                  the   message,   and  it  should  be  reported
                  promptly to  hardware  maintenance  personnel.
                  The  user should repeat his command -- perhaps
                  several times.


             COMPARE ERROR

                  This message indicates catastrophic failure of
                  the disk controller.  It should occur with far
                  less  frequency  than  virtually   any   other
                  message.   Occurrences  should  be immediately
                  reported to hardware maintenance personnel.


             CAN'T WRITE INDEX

                  The user has performed some  strange  sequence
                  of  actions,  or  a bug in PFS, has caused the
                  directory to  become  disarranged.   The  user
                  should  repeat  his command.  Failing a second
                  time, he should leave PFS and re-enter.

             CAN'T READ INDEX
             INDEX CLOBBERED

                  These messages result from various  checks  on
                  the  directory  as  it is read from disk.  The
                  user should retry and if  he  cannot  get  the
                  directory   to  read  successfully  he  should
                  contact operations personnel.
