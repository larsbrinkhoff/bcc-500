**RUNOFF

              The general procedure for producing mailing  labels  on
         the BCC 500 is:

              1.  Prepare a file consisting of all of the addressees.
                   Usually  this  file  will  have been prepared pre-
                   viously but may require updating.  The text editor
                   (QED) is used for this purpose.

              2.  Retrieve and run the  label-making  program.   This
                   program  re-formats  the  addressee  file from one
                   which is convenient for creation and  modification
                   via  a  terminal  into  one  which fits a standard
                   sheet of mailing labels.

              3.  Install the mailing label forms in the line  print-
                   er.  The processed addressee file (the output file
                   of the label-maker program) is then printed on the
                   forms,  after  which the line printer is re-fitted
                   with  normal  paper   and   restored   to   normal
                   operation.

              Detailed instructions for each of the three steps  fol-
         low:



         1.``Preparation`of`the`Addressees`File.         ``  ``````````` `` ``` `````````` `````

              The file is prepared using  the  text  editor.   It  is
         possible  (and  it  has been done successfully) to copy into
         the system via magnetic tape an existing mailing list  file.
         For  example,  many  such  lists exist in punched-card form.
         Without any further program preparation, such a  file  (con-
         sisting  of  boxes  of  cards)  can be read in the Computing
         Center and transferred to 800 BPI,  9-track  magnetic  tape.
         The  BCC-500  can copy this tape into a file consisting of a
         line of text for each card read.  The text editor  can  then
         be  used  to make any modifications required to get the file
         into correct format for the label-making program.

              The format of the addressee file is quite simple.   The
         file  consists  of  an  entry (a few lines of text) for each
         mailing label to be printed.   Entries  are  separated  from
         each  other  by  a single line which begins with one or more
         asterisks.  After the initial asterisk  the  separator  line
         may  contain any information which might be later useful for
         file maintenance.  The size of a mailing label restricts the
         number  of  lines  in  each  entry  to be no more than five.
         Similarly, each line may have in it no more than 39  charac-
         ters.   If  either  of  these  restrictions is violated, the
                                                               Page  2


         label-making program will truncate the  information  to  fit
         within the available space on the label.

              The following example shows the first few lines of such
         a file.

              The addressee file  can  now  be  considered  complete.
         Mailing  lists  prepared from it will have identical form in
         each label, i.e., the labels will be printed  in  upper-case
         only.  Alternatively, the file can be processed further into
         a format which is suitable for RUNOFF.  The RUNOFF output of
         such  a  file  will  have upper- and lower-case letters; the
         entries will appear more as if they had been typed  individ-
         ually.

              Of course the file could  have  been  created  in  this
         RUNOFF-compatible  format  initially.   It  is perhaps a bit
         cumbersome to do this for a large number  of  entries,  how-
         ever;  and  it  would  be most trying to modify a previously
         existing upper-case file or one just  copied  from  magnetic
         tape.   Thus  a  program has been prepared to capitalize (in
         the RUNOFF sense) all words beginning with  letters  in  the
         entries.  This is generally correct; but it will not produce
         perfect results.  The program is intended merely  to  reduce
         the  amount  of  manual  editing  of the file down to a very
         small level.  The program -- called  "CAPS"  --  copies  the
         addressee file onto a new file, transforming the information

              To use CAPS, first retrieve the file from PFS (the file
         is  a  940  DUMP  file).   Type  the system command "RECOVER
         CAPS".  Then type "START;G".  CAPS first asks for  an  input
         file  name.   Type  the name of the totally upper-case file,
         followed by ".".  Next CAPS asks for an  output  file  name.
         Type  a new file name surrounded by double-quotes and then a
         period.  The program then does its work and exits by ringing
         the bell on the terminal and typing an extra carriage return
         and line feed.  Return to the system command level by typing
         "%F".

              The (new) addressee file is now in a form suitable  for
         RUNOFF.   Processing  the file with RUNOFF will yield a file
         which needs only re-formatting to  fit  the  mailing  labels
         form.  If the addressee file has just been processed by CAPS
         however, it should first be  processed  by  RUNOFF  and  the
         output printed for proofreading to see where further editing
         of the addressee file may be required.  After final editing,
         the addressee file will be saved on the disk under PFS.  The
         text editor will be used  subsequently  to  make  additions,
                                                               Page  4


         deletions,  and  changes to the file.  The editing should be
         done such that each of the new or modified entries appear as
         in  the  second  case  given  above.   The  CAPS  program is
         intended to be used only  once  in  the  preparation  an  an
         addressee file.



         2.``Making`the`Actual`Labels`File.         ``  `````` ``` `````` `````` `````

              Beginning with a valid addressee file, the  first  step
         is  to process the file with RUNOFF.  (That is, assuming the
         file is in the form of RUNOFF input; otherwise, one can skip
         down  to  the re-formatting paragraph below.)  This is quite
         easy.  RUNOFF is a subsystem, so one merely types  the  name
         "RUNOFF"  as  a  system  command (i.e., after the "@" sign).
         When RUNOFF becomes active it asks for an input file.   Type
         the  name  of  the  addressee file, followed by ".".  Typing
         errors can be cancelled with control-A.   After  doing  some
         processing,  RUNOFF will ask for the name of an output file.
         Do NOT give the name of the input file; give the name  of  a
         new  file  (and  surround  it with double-quotes).  The file
         thus produced will have upper- and lower-case characters  in
         it  and is almost ready for re-formatting.  But it will also
         have a couple of undesirable features in it which should  be
         removed  before  this  step.   The easiest way to do this is
         with QED.

              Read in the file and delete the first line.  (The  line
         will  say  "**RUNOFF"  and  is  a command from RUNOFF to the
         printing program to let it know what  kind  of  file  it  is
         about  to  print.   We  don't want the line since we are not
         going to print this file.)  Second, delete  every  control-L
         in  the  file.  (These are likewise page eject commands from
         RUNOFF to the printing program and are out of  place  here.)
         Simply  say  to  QED, "@SUBSTITUTE // FOR /<control-L>/.  To
         type the control-L in this command, you must type  control-V
         followed  by  control-L.   After deleting the first line and
         removing all the control-L's, write the file back  out.   It
         is now ready for re-formatting and appears as follows:

              Re-formatting  is  done  by  means   of   the   program
         LABEL-MAKER.  After getting the program from the disk (it is
         in the form of a 940 DUMP file),  type  the  system  command
         "RECOVER  LABEL-MAKER".  Then type START;G.  Like RUNOFF the
         program asks for an input file.  Type the name of  the  file
         just  made  and  edited, followed by ".".  The programs then
         asks for an output file name.  Type the name of  yet  a  new
         file.   The  program  then copies information from its input
         file onto its output file, re-formatting it  so  that  three
         columns  are made and placed exactly where labels will be on
         the label forms.  The program will terminate by ringing  the
         terminal  bell  and  doing an extra carriage return and line
         feed.  Other label files can be made, each  time  by  typing
         "START; G"  and  repeating the file name business.  When the
         last file has been processed, exit to  the  command-language
         level of the system by typing "%F".



         3.``Printing`the`Labels.         ``  ```````` ``` ```````

              The final step must be performed in Holmes Hall.   Pos-
         sibly  someone  working with the system regularly can assist
         in setting up the printer.  Anyone can do it, however,  once
         having  been  shown how.  These instructions are intended as
         reminders for someone previously checked out on the  proced-
         ure.

              The line printer should not be in use.  Type  "PREEMPT"
         to  KDF  (the  peripheral devices program) to insure that no
         one will start a print going while you are  setting  up  the
         printer.
                                                               Page  6


              Turn on the printer, hit the TOP OF FORM  button,  open
         the printer cabinet, and remove the paper from it.  Move the
         left tractor mechanisms about  1"  to  the  right.   Install
         label forms on the left tractors only and place them so that
         the left edge of the  paper  just  barely  covers  the  slot
         containing  the  print hammers.  Make sure the upper tractor
         is placed so that the paper  is  perfectly  vertical.   Then
         move the right tractors so they engage the forms properly.

              Log in the system  on  one  of  the  nearby  terminals,
         retrieve your print file if it is presently on PFS, and also
         retrieve the file "ALIGNMENT-TXT".  Turn the printer  platen
         so  that  the  gap  between labels is aligned with the black
         top-of-form alignment mark on the left side of the  printer.
         Close  the  printer  cabinet, hit the PRINT button, and then
         type to KDF, "PRINT @<your  name>:ALIGNMENT-TXT, A".   Allow
         only  a few lines to print and then hit the STOP button.  on
         the printer.  Inspect the printing for  vertical  alignment.
         If  it  is  not correct (there really isn't much tolerance),
         make a slight correction of the printer  platen,  hit  PRINT
         again  and  let  a few more lines print before hitting STOP.
         Repeat as required until  vertical  alignment  is  achieved;
         then  let  the  rest of the file print.  It is less than one
         page long and will not waste many labels.  Now return to KDF
         and  type  "PRINT  @<your  name>:<your file>,A".  The labels
         will now be printed.  This can be done  for  as  many  label
         print  files as exist at the moment, after which the printer
         must be restored to normal operation.

              Remove the label form paper and push the left  tractors
         back  into  normal  position.  There is a groove on the rods
         holding the tractor mechanisms into  which  a  detent  fits.
         Push  each  tractor  all  the  way to the left and then back
         right just enough that a "click" is felt.   Push  the  right
         tractors  back  toward  the  right.   Place the normal paper
         forms in the left tractors and then adjust the  right  trac-
         tors  so  that  the paper is held properly; the teeth in the
         right mechanisms should be exactly  in  the  center  of  the
         holes.   Hit  the  TOP OF FORM button and move the platen so
         that the nearest crease in the paper  is  aligned  with  the
         black  alignment mark to the left of the printer.  Close the
         printer cabinet and type "UNPREEMPT" to KDF.  If no printing
         begins, turn off the printer.
